Visit to Sarah and collected:

very large paper coloured drawings that I made at Watlington Studio. I got this paper from John Purcell.

Also 2 prints from Adolfo -one dedicated to Sarah. These print were framed by the framers that had a studio in Cricket Street

Note- what am I to do with these drawings?
