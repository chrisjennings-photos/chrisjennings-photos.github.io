## Introduction
This is where I show my photographs. It’s not the only place because I might put something up to Facebook or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chris.jennings.art/) occasionally. Anyway, let me explain how this works.

I keep my photographs on Flickr because I really like the way I can easily keep things organised there. But also - I can publish the photos here by using their API. [You can read about how this works over on my *notes* site](https://notes.chrisjennings.net/Articles/Using-Flickr-to-Generate-an-Image-Gallery/).

## This site - how did I do it?
This site is published from a GitHub repository using the [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)  static site generator with the *[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)* Theme. I have modified this quite a bit and added some plugins to make it work better as a photo site.

### How do I write and publish?
Here’s the clever thing - I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write the pages and then use the Git extension to _Push_ the pages up to GitHub which then generates the page.
