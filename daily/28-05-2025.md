Getting Apple Photos to LightRoom

Use PhotosTakeOut but select albums in list view

This will make the file dates the time of exporting

So, use exiftool to change the dates back to their created dates...

Here are the codes for Terminal
```
find . -name "*.json" -delete
```

```
find . -name "*.MOV" -delete
```


```
find . -name "Live Videos" -delete
```


```
exiftool -r "-FileModifyDate<DateTimeOriginal" /Volumes/1TB\ Photos/Photography
```
