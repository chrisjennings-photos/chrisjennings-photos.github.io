Gym in the morning not too busy

Set up Dany's new phone... transfer data has become so easy now. 

Down to Osney on my bike. Did a bit of cleaning the boat. Bedding all ready to sleep aboard. Still can't find that pot of paint...

Went to the Ben Parsons Galley. Last show. Ben promised he would come for a studio visit again.
