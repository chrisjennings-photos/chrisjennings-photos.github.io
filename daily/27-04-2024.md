Cold damp day again. 

## Reviewing Photo editor and management tools...

Frankly Lightroom is best but if I lose access to Adobe CC do I want to pay Â£119 per year? (Lightroom and Photoshop)

What would be the alternatives?

*Darktable* looks good and is free but does not have an iOS version.

*Darkroom* could work but that needs to be used with Apple Photos; would I have enough space? It doesn't work with files. One off price or subscription.

*Nitro* could work but no iOS version yet

*PhotoOrganista* could be good but it has so many oddities that I cannot get on with it.

*PhotoMechanic* is only for Apple PS not mobile and costs an absolute fortune

*Photomator* is best for me but let me give the comparison
