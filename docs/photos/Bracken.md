The seasons in the forest are marked by the colour of the bracken that carpets the ground under the tree canopy.

In the late spring in my local forest (Wytham Woods), the bracken is becoming dense and the colour of the young shoots stands out bright green, contrasting against the dark tones of the tree trunks.
